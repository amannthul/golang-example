# Paths to exclude when searching for Protobuf files.
# These can either be file or directory names.
# If there is a directory name, that directory and all sub-directories will be excluded.
excludes:
  - node_modules
  - examples
  - tools
  - gen
  - bin
  - 3rd_party
#  - path/to/b/file.proto

# Protoc directives.
protoc:
  # The Protobuf version to use from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases.
  # By default use 3.8.0.
  # You probably want to set this to make your builds completely reproducible.
  version: 3.12.4

  # Additional paths to include with -I to protoc.
  # By default, the directory of the config file is included,
  # or the current directory if there is no config file.
  #includes:
  #  - ../../vendor/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/third_party/googleapis
  # If not set, compile will fail if there are unused imports.
  # Setting this will ignore unused imports.
  #allow_unused_imports: true

# Create directives.
create:
  # List of mappings from relative directory to base package.
  # This affects how packages are generated with create.
  packages:
    - directory: idl/example
      name: example
    # - directory: idl/tools
    #   name: tools

# Lint directives.
lint:
  # The lint group to use.
  # Available groups: "uber1", "uber2", "google", "empty".
  # The default group is the "uber1" lint group for backwards compatibility reasons,
  # however we recommend using the "uber2" lint group.
  # The special group "empty" has no linters, allowing you to manually specify all
  # lint rules in lint.rules.add.
  # Run prototool lint --list-all-lint-groups to see all available lint groups.
  # Run prototool lint --list-lint-group GROUP to list the linters in the given lint group.
  group: uber2
  # rules:
  #   add:
  #     - RPCS_NO_STREAMING
  #     - RPC_OPTIONS_NO_GOOGLE_API_HTTP

  # The path to the file header or the file header content for all Protobuf files.
  # If either path or content is set and the FILE_HEADER linter is turned on,
  # files will be checked to begin with the given header, and format --fix
  # will place this header before the syntax declaration. Note that
  # format --fix will delete anything before the syntax declaration
  # if this is set.
  #
  # Set path to use a file's contents for the header. Path must be relative.
  # Set content to directly specify the header.
  # **Both path and content cannot be set at the same time. They are only done
  # so here for example purposes.**
  #
  # If is_commented is set, this file is assumed to already have comments
  # and will be added directly. If is_commented is not set, "// " will be
  # added before every line.
  file_header:
    content: |
      //
      // amannthul. (c) 2021
      //
    is_commented: true
  # Override the default java_package file option prefix of "com".
  # If this is set, this will affect lint, create, and format --fix to use.
  # this prefix instead of "com".
#  java_package_prefix: au.com
